# Chavez_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Summary:
In my final project I will be working alone. I have decided to implement the use of a hash table of linked lists to create a course registration system for the CU Boulder Computer Science department. I have made the program to only register for summer 2016 lower division computer science course. The user will be able to provide what class they would like to enroll in and they will be able to see if the class is full or not. I have added an admin menu function in order to have some sort of power in the program which can call for the use of deleting and other functions not available to the typical user.
The end.....

InstructionS:
ADMIN PASSWORD/EMPLOYEE I.D IS: 4201997
The program is simple most instructions are printed within the program itself. The program needs to run with the CourseList.txt file because it reads all the class information from there, if it doesnt then there will be no classes, but do not fear! New classes can be added from within the administrator menu. Classes inputed should be in the form of the course number (e.g 2270) a section number, a class name, class dates and times, available seats, instructor name, and how many credit hours its worth.
If the you run the program with the courselist.txt file it is simple. The program is super straigh forward and has instructions within. If the program asks for class info it must be input like this ---> course number (e.g 2270 (only a four digit number), a section number(a 3 digit number), a class name(your choice), class dates and times(your choice), available seats(your choice but it must be input as a number e.g 42), instructor name(your choice), and how many credit hours its worth(your choice but it must be input as a number e.g 3). When asked for your major, it must be inputted as "CSCI" if you are a comp sci major.
I have not noticed any bugs as of yet.
